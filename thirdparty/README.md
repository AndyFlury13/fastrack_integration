# Third party software

This contains software that is usually not available through the system
package manager.

**Note** Only include software here that is either a header-only library or
can be built as a static library. Do not use any of this software as part of
the public interface and only include it in pure implementation files to avoid
issues with missing files after installation.

`nlohmann_json` is exempted from this rule as it is handled specially.
